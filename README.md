# Mul-seam-Carving-Alg
This is a small project implementing the advanced Seam Carving algorithm. This is an optional project in a course "Introduction to Algorithm Analysis" at my university. The script was written in Python and is not optimized :), so I hope someone read it may help contribute to it if you like. The improved version of the algorithm is implemented based on a paper referenced below.
