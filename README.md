# Mul-seam-Carving-Alg
This is a small project implementing the advanced Seam Carving algorithm. If you haven't known what Seam Carving algorithm is, uhmm, google it :D. So instead of carving one seam at a time, this project allows you to carve multiple seams. This is an optional project in a course "Introduction to Algorithm Analysis" at my university. The script was written in Python and is not optimized :), so I hope someone read it may help contribute to it if you like. The improved version of the algorithm is implemented from the idea in a paper below.

## Requirement

- `python v3.5.6`
- `opencv`
- `numpy`

## Example

This is a cute picture a couple of bunnies :).

I set the number of seams need to be carved is 100.

Here is the result:

Great huh?
